# Alonso Bur√≥n's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! Here you'll find a collection of projects and analyses showcasing my expertise in data science, computer usage, and technical support. 

## About Me

I am a passionate data enthusiast with a strong foundation in Python programming, IT support, and a keen interest in data science. Currently pursuing a Data Science Bachelor's degree, I am committed to leveraging data-driven insights to solve real-world problems.

## Projects

### Project 1: MiniProyecto 

- **Description:** Exploration of different SkLearn algorithms, after database cleanup. Using BandCamp's Sales data.
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, MatPlotLib
- **Key Contributions:** A lot of data in sales is relevant for frontend systems, but not so for analysis and sales prediction. Music tends to miss a lot of data about the music itself, as it's not embedded but rather has to be analyzed (either manually or using AI) in order to be discovered and quantified.
